In this section, you will learn how to use pgcrud's built-in functions to 
perform **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations. We have provided illustrative code 
examples to guide you through pgcrud's functionality.

Before you get started, make sure to set up the demo database schema we have prepared for 
you [here](https://github.com/dakivara/pgcrud/tree/main/demo/setup_schema.sql) to run the code 
examples with the provided data.
